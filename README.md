# NativeBayes
This research makes full use the characteristics of solid mathematical foundation and stable classification efficiency of naive bayes classification method. It proposes a semantic Web service classification method based on the theory of naive bayes. It elaborates the concrete process of how to use the three stages of bayesian classification to classify the semantic Web services in the consideration of service interface and execution capacity. 
## Processing
Firstly, it uses the self-join operation in RDB to cluster service to form different service clusters. <br>
Then it organizes different service clusters in further according to the service execution dependency relationship, and thus to realize service aggregation. 
<br>Finally, the service selection function is implemented to meet usersâ€™ personal requirements.
