Firstly, it uses the self-join operation in RDB to cluster service to form different service clusters. <br>
Then it organizes different service clusters in further according to the service execution dependency relationship, and thus to realize service aggregation. 
<br>Finally, the service selection function is implemented to meet usersâ€™ personal requirements.
